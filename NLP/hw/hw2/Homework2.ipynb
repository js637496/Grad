Then, choose \"Data\" from the sub-header, preview some of the csv data and notice how at least one of the columns in the dataset will contain sufficient text. I chose to direct you to these two datasets because the textual content seemed interesting and would have different language characteristics, and both were large csv files that could generate significant n-gram counts, but not be too large of a file.\n",
